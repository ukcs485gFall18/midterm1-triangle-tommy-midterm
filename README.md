## Introduction ##
Our application is a music playlist tool that will allow users to create collaborative playlists on the fly at social gatherings. To complete this application, we followed the “Raze Player” tutorial from Raywenderlich.com to build the base music player functionality and user interface. This tutorial taught us how to create an Apple Music-like interface for the user, containing a mini-player toolbar at the bottom, and a zoomed-in player view animation. While the tutorial only included sample data for songs and did not play the music, our midterm app was able to add these functionalities by integrating the Spotify iOS framework and web API. 

## Added Features ##
1. Login with Spotify
1. Querying the API with Alamofire and loading Spotify Songs
1. Searching the Spotify database
1. Audio playback
